# Upgrade Guide to Version 1.0.8

## What's New

Version 1.0.8 fixes the **"Graph Not Displaying"** issue that was preventing charts from rendering in both the admin dashboard and frontend widgets.

## The Problem (v1.0.7 and earlier)

Charts were not displaying because:
- Chart.js library loaded from CDN (cdn.jsdelivr.net)
- CDN was being blocked by:
  - Hosting provider firewalls
  - Ad blockers
  - Network restrictions
  - Corporate firewalls
- Script loading order issues
- Duplicate script localizations causing conflicts

## The Solution (v1.0.8)

âœ… **Chart.js is now bundled locally** - No more CDN dependencies
âœ… **Fixed script loading order** - Proper dependency chains
âœ… **Removed duplicate code** - Eliminated script conflicts
âœ… **Enhanced error handling** - Clear troubleshooting messages
âœ… **Cache busting** - Version-based file loading

## How to Upgrade

### Step 1: Backup (Recommended)
```bash
# Backup your current plugin folder
cp -r wp-content/plugins/orkla-water-level wp-content/plugins/orkla-water-level.backup
```

### Step 2: Upload New Files
1. Download the v1.0.8 plugin files
2. Replace the entire `orkla-water-level` folder in `wp-content/plugins/`
3. Make sure these new files are present:
   - `assets/js/vendor/chart.min.js`
   - `assets/js/vendor/chartjs-adapter-date-fns.bundle.min.js`

### Step 3: Clear All Caches
```
Browser Cache: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
WordPress Cache: Clear from your caching plugin
Server Cache: Clear from your hosting control panel
CDN Cache: Purge if using Cloudflare/similar
```

### Step 4: Verify the Upgrade

#### Quick Check:
1. Go to admin dashboard: Water Level â†’ Dashboard
2. You should see charts displaying
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for: `âœ“ Chart.js loaded successfully (version 3.9.1)`

#### Full Health Check:
1. Upload `test-plugin-health.php` to WordPress root
2. Access: `https://yoursite.com/test-plugin-health.php`
3. Review all test results
4. **Delete the file after testing** (security)

### Step 5: Test Frontend
1. Visit a page with `[orkla_water_level]` shortcode
2. Verify charts are displaying
3. Try different time periods (today, week, month, year)
4. Check browser console for errors

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Graphs Still Not Showing

**Solution 1: Hard Refresh**
```
Press: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Press: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

**Solution 2: Clear Browser Data**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**Solution 3: Check File Permissions**
```bash
# Make sure vendor files are readable
chmod 644 wp-content/plugins/orkla-water-level/assets/js/vendor/*.js
```

**Solution 4: Run Health Check**
Upload and run `test-plugin-health.php` to diagnose the issue.

### Issue: "Chart.js is NOT loaded" Error

This should NOT happen in v1.0.8, but if it does:

1. **Verify files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh wp-content/plugins/orkla-water-level/assets/js/vendor/
   # Should show:
   # chart.min.js (195 KB)
   # chartjs-adapter-date-fns.bundle.min.js (50 KB)
   ```

2. **Check file permissions:**
   ```bash
   # Files should be readable by web server
   chmod 644 wp-content/plugins/orkla-water-level/assets/js/vendor/*.js
   ```

3. **Verify in browser:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Refresh page
   - Look for `chart.min.js` - should load with status 200

### Issue: No Data Available

This is a separate issue from v1.0.8 fixes. To resolve:

1. Go to: Water Level â†’ Debug Status
2. Check "Total records in database"
3. If 0 records, click "Run Full Historical Import"
4. Wait for import to complete
5. Refresh the page

### Issue: AJAX Errors

Check these:
1. **Plugin activated:** Plugins â†’ Installed Plugins
2. **WordPress version:** Requires WP 5.0+
3. **PHP version:** Check in Site Health
4. **Debug.log:** Check `wp-content/debug.log` for errors
