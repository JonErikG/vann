# No Graphs Showing - Quick Fix Guide

## Problem
Graphs are not showing in either backend admin dashboard or frontend pages.

## Most Likely Cause
**Chart.js library not loading from CDN**

This happens when:
- Server firewall blocks cdn.jsdelivr.net
- Ad blocker blocks CDN
- Network restrictions
- Script loading order issues

## Quick Diagnostic

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open any page with a graph (admin or frontend)
2. Press **F12** to open developer tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for this message:

**If you see:**
```
Chart.js is NOT loaded! Cannot render graphs.
```
**Then**: Chart.js CDN is blocked. Continue to Step 2.

**If you see:**
```
Chart.js loaded successfully (version 3.9.1)
```
**Then**: Chart.js is loading. Issue is elsewhere. Skip to Step 3.

### Step 2: Test CDN Access
Upload `test-csv-fetch.php` to your WordPress root and access it:
```
https://orklavannstand.online/test-csv-fetch.php
```

This will test:
- Server access to cdn.jsdelivr.net
- Browser access to Chart.js
- Data CSV accessibility

**If Test 1 (Server CDN access) fails:**
- Contact your hosting provider
- Ask them to whitelist: `cdn.jsdelivr.net`
- Or ask them to allow external CDN access

**If Test 3 (Browser loads Chart.js) fails:**
- Disable ad blockers
- Check browser extensions
- Try a different browser
- Check firewall settings

### Step 3: Check for Plugin/Theme Conflicts
If Chart.js loads but graphs still don't show:

1. **Switch to default theme:**
   - Go to Appearance > Themes
   - Activate Twenty Twenty-Four
   - Check if graphs appear

2. **Disable other plugins:**
   - Disable all plugins except Orkla Water Level
   - Check if graphs appear
   - Re-enable one by one to find the conflict

## Updated Plugin Features

I've added diagnostic features to help identify the issue:

### 1. Visual Error Messages
If Chart.js doesn't load, you'll now see a clear error message in the chart area explaining the problem.

### 2. Console Logging
The plugin now logs:
```
Orkla Admin JS loaded
Chart.js loaded successfully (version 3.9.1)
Initializing admin chart
```

Or if there's an issue:
```
Chart.js is NOT loaded! Cannot render graphs.
```

### 3. Backend Diagnostic Tools
- **Dashboard**: Added "Full Historical Import" button (red)
- **Debug Status**: Shows database status and records
- **Test Files**: Multiple diagnostic test files

## Files Updated

1. **orkla-water-level.php**
   - Added full import capability
   - Enhanced logging throughout
   - Better error handling

2. **assets/js/admin.js**
   - Added Chart.js detection
   - Shows error message if Chart.js missing
   - Logs version to console

3. **assets/js/frontend.js**
   - Added Chart.js detection
   - Shows error message if Chart.js missing
   - Logs version to console

4. **templates/admin-page.php**
   - Added "Full Historical Import" button
   - Clearer button labels

## Test Files Available

Upload these to your WordPress root for testing:

1. **test-frontend.php** - Complete frontend test suite
2. **test-database-status.php** - Database verification
3. **test-csv-fetch.php** - CDN and CSV access test

## Expected Console Output

### Admin Dashboard (Working)
```

```

## Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Server Blocks CDN
**Contact hosting support with this message:**
```
Hi, my WordPress plugin needs to access cdn.jsdelivr.net to load
Chart.js library. Can you please whitelist this CDN domain?
The required URL is: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@3.9.1/
```

### Solution 2: Ad Blocker
- Disable ad blocker for your site
- Or whitelist cdn.jsdelivr.net
- Or use browser without extensions

### Solution 3: Browser Cache
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Do hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Try incognito/private mode

### Solution 4: WordPress Cache
- Clear WordPress cache
- Clear any CDN cache
- Flush object cache if using Redis/Memcached

## Verification Steps

After trying fixes:

1. **Refresh browser with Ctrl+Shift+R**
2. **Open console (F12)**
3. **Look for "Chart.js loaded successfully"**
4. **Check if graph appears**
5. **Look for AJAX success messages**

## Support Checklist

If still not working, gather this info:

- [ ] Browser console output (F12 > Console)
- [ ] Network tab showing failed requests (F12 > Network)
- [ ] Results from test-csv-fetch.php
- [ ] Results from test-frontend.php
- [ ] WordPress debug log errors
- [ ] Hosting provider name
- [ ] Active theme name
- [ ] List of active plugins

## Next Steps

1. **Upload and run test-csv-fetch.php**
2. **Check browser console on admin dashboard**
3. **Look for "Chart.js loaded successfully" or error**
4. **Based on the error message, follow appropriate solution**

Most likely you'll see that Chart.js cannot load from CDN, and you'll need to contact your hosting provider to whitelist cdn.jsdelivr.net.
