- ‚úÖ "Chart.js found"
- ‚úÖ "All tests passed!"

### Step 4: Test Frontend

1. Add to a page: `[orkla_water_display]`
2. Visit the page
3. You should see graphs and meters with current data

### Step 5: Clean Up

Delete the fix script (security):

rm fix-and-test.php
```

**Done! Your system should be working again.**
